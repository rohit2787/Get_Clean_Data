The raw data was a set of 8 text files and 2 text files of other supporting material:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Supporting files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

Steps taken:
1. Read files features.txt and activity_labels.txt and save them in separate data frames.
2. Creat a logical vector that identifies the features that include 'mean' or 'std' in them.
3. Read files X_test and use the data obtained from features.txt to give variable names. Reduce the data frame by applying the logical vector created in step 2 over the columns of this dataframe.
4. Read files y_test and subject_test into 2 separate data frames
5. Combine data frames created in step 3 and 4 using cbind() to create a data frame for the test data.
6. Repeat the steps 3 and 4 for the train data set.
7. Combine a complete data set using rbind() over both test and train data sets.
8. Using factors in activity_labels data frame replace the label number with the activity name in the unified data set.
9. Using melt and cast re-arrange the dataset to obtain average of each feature variable for each subject-activity combination.
10. write the final data.frame to a text file.

The tidy data has the following variable names:
[1] "Subject" - Index number of the subject who wore the devised and performed the activity. Takes values from 1-30, for 30 individuals.
[2] "Activity_Label" - Indicates the activity that was performed while recording the data in the relevant test or while training. 
[3] to [88] - Average of mean and standard deviation of various features of the data like acceleration, time, angular acceleration etc. for each subject, activity combination.
